  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      macOS requires you to grant Screen Recording permissions to Core Audio Tap tools.
      
      When you first open Pioneer Rekordbox, macOS will prompt you to grant Screen Recording permission to auto-rb-recorder.
      You MUST grant this permission in System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Screen Recording, or the daemon cannot intercept the audio!
